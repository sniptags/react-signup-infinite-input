This React based page is a small snippet from my React application that creates a multi step SignUp page that can have infinite fields.

Application uses Redux to handle the central state for business/user signup data, fetched data for cities,categories and services.

Users can add as many cities/categories and services they like while application validates for duplication,required fields and validates for input fields.

Firebase Realtime database has been used to mock the backend APIs

Initial Application is created using Create-React-App.

Feel free to use this code and make enhancements where required.
